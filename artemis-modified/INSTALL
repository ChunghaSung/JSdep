 0. Fetch all software dependencies using
    
      make fetch-[apt|yum] (requires root privileges)
	
    Due to previous version of Artemis does not provide correct link of qt,
    we provide the link to download compatible qt version. Therefore, if 
    you have no Qt or a version older than 4.8.x then type this commands: 

      ./fetch-qt

    This will download and extract a compatible Qt version, and compile it in
    the ``qt/`` folder with installing it.

1. Set up your environment variables by running
    
      export QTDIR=<qtpath>
      export PATH=$QTDIR/bin:$PATH

    where `<qtpath>` is the QT installation directory, either
    the one provided by your distribution or the ``qt/`` folder 
    from step 0.

    You can check your qt version using the command ``qmake --version``
    or ``qmake --version``
    (if qmake is not present then Qt is not installed).
    
     
 2. Build and install Artemis
   
   	  make install

 3. Add the instrumented WebKit library to your library path

      export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<path>/WebKit/WebKitBuild/Release/lib  

    where `<path>` is the root directory of the Artemis repository.

    You will need to add this environment variable every time you
    subsequently wish to use Artemis.
