 0. Fetch all software dependencies using
    
      make fetch-[apt|yum] (requires root privileges)
	
    If you have no Qt or a version older than 4.8.x then run: 

      make fetch-qt

    This will fetch and compile a compatible Qt version and place it in
    the ``qt/`` folder.

    You can check your qt version using the command ``qmake --version``
    (if qmake is not present then Qt is not installed).
    
 1. Set up your environment variables by running
    
      export QTDIR=<qtpath>
      export PATH=$QTDIR/bin:$PATH

    where `<qtpath>` is the QT 4.8 installation directory, either
    the one provided by your distribution or the ``qt/`` folder 
    from step 0.

    On Ubuntu this is /usr/share/qt4
     
 2. Build and install Artemis
   
   	  make install

 3. Add the instrumented WebKit library to your library path

      export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<path>/WebKit/WebKitBuild/Release/lib  

    where `<path>` is the root directory of the Artemis repository.

    You will need to add this environment variable every time you
    subsequently wish to use Artemis.
